# Bright-Field Polarimetric Microscope

URL to access the Bright Field Polarimetric Microscope Web Application:

http://3.143.246.230:5000/

In the main interface of this app, the user can interact with the elements that compose the polarimetric microscope, such as the polarization-states analyzer and the polarization states generator, the Jones matrices that make up the sample, the magnification, the numerical aperture of the instrument, and the wavelength of the illumination source. The web application includes two more interfaces for experimental or synthetic data post-processing. In the first interface, the computing of the dichroic response of a microscopic sample can be performed. The second interface allows computing the Stokes parameters of a light beam as long as its general, linear, and circular degree of polarization.

In this repository, test images can be found to start using the application. Then you can create your own images in the polarimetric microscope window and save them on your computer, or you can record them experimentally following the information given in the web app.
