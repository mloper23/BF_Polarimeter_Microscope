In the application you will be able to calculate Stokes parameters of an illumination source, the dichroic (or linear diattenuation) response of a sample and simulate your own polarimetric-microscopic sample. 

In this repository test images can be found to start to use the application. Then you can create your own images in the polarimetric microscope window and save them in your own computer or you can record them experimentally following the information given in the web app. (Reference the paper)
